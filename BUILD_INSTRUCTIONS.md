## üì± Building Standalone App for iPhone

### Prerequisites
1. **Apple Developer Account** (required for iOS)
   - Free account: Can install on your own device
   - Paid account ($99/year): Can distribute to others

2. **EAS CLI** (already installed)

### Step 1: Login to Expo
```powershell
cd C:\Users\gh\CascadeProjects\retail-pos\mobile-app
eas login
```
Create a free Expo account if you don't have one.

### Step 2: Configure the Project
```powershell
eas build:configure
```
This creates/updates the `eas.json` file (already done).

### Step 3: Build for iOS

#### Option A: Development Build (Install on your device via cable)
```powershell
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

#### Option B: Preview Build (Install via link - no cable needed)
```powershell
eas build --profile preview --platform ios
```

#### Option C: Production Build (For App Store)
```powershell
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

### Step 4: Install on Your iPhone

After the build completes (15-30 minutes):

1. **You'll get a download link** in the terminal
2. **Open the link on your iPhone**
3. **Download and install** the `.ipa` file
4. **Trust the developer certificate**:
   - Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
   - Tap your Apple ID
   - Tap "Trust"

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

eas login
eas build --profile preview --platform ios
```

Then:
1. Wait for build to complete (~20 mins)
2. Open the link on your iPhone
3. Install the app
4. Trust the certificate in Settings

## üìù Important Notes

### Backend Server
The app still needs to connect to your backend server:
- **Current setup**: Uses `http://192.168.1.167:3000/api`
- **For production**: You'll need to:
  1. Deploy backend to a cloud server (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
  2. Update `mobile-app/src/services/api.js` with the production URL
  3. Rebuild the app

### Alternative: TestFlight (Recommended for Multiple Devices)
1. Build with production profile
2. Submit to App Store Connect
3. Add testers via TestFlight
4. They can install via TestFlight app (no cable needed)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Make sure you're logged in: `eas whoami`
- Check your Apple ID is configured: `eas credentials`

### Can't Install on iPhone
- Make sure you're using the same Apple ID
- Trust the certificate in Settings
- For free account: Max 3 devices, expires after 7 days

### App Won't Connect to Backend
- Backend must be accessible from your phone's network
- Consider deploying backend to cloud for production use
